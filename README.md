This project is an express ejs app integrated with neo4j database, user can perform CRUD operations for games, order them, add some of them to favourites, import whole list of games from json file, find and sort games by different criteria. Also there are some statistics (popularity by number of comments, orders etc.). Certain administrative functionalities, such as CRUD operations, are exclusively accessible to administrators, ensuring secure and controlled management of the platform's resources.
